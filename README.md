Blog site

Used language - JavaScript
Layout - bootstrap framework. 
The site was build on MVC logic.

The site uses role model with two roles (user and admin), to control the content availability.
The Admin role allows to edit and delete everything, while the user can edit only its own writings and settings.
The blog allows both roles to create articles(stored in the articles JSON model), which are then referenced to different categories.
The articles also have hashtag\s option which can be used(with a click on it), to search other articles with similar content.
Everyone who visits the site is allowed to read the articles and to write comments below them, even the unregistered users.
This sums up the main functions implemented in the blog.
